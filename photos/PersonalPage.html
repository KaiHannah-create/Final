<p>Hello, my name is Kai Hannah! I am a sophomore at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash campus. I went to high school in Sharonville, Ohio, at Princeton High School, where I received my high school diploma. I plan to continue studying Applied Media Communications for 2 years at the Blue Ash campus before transferring to the main campus to finish my degree.</p>

<p>I have always had an interest in all things media. Television, Movies, Social Media, Broadcasting, and even some interest in the radio field. I got my first camera the Christmas of my 8th grade year in middle school. I would shoot all kinds of videos and photos of everything I could get my hands on. I fell out of sports and more into the arts throughout my high school career, which led me to the IB film program my school provided. </p>

<p>I spent the back three years of high school shooting all kinds of school projects and even some videos for pep rallies and things of that matter. This threw fuel into the fire of what was my passion for being behind a camera, creating a scene through a camera lens, and showing off my work, which led me to want to pursue this creative dive throughout my college career. It also gave me a ton of practice for shooting a scene.</p>

<p>I want to, at some point in my life, create a full feature-length film and see my name in the credits. It would be out of this world if I could do this from the seat of a director's chair, but a boy can dream. I want to receive awards for my work, and I want to change the whole industry in a way where people are treated more as humans while on a set or program rather than as employees or objects to gain fame or attention. The media scene is not a pretty place, with a ton of hate and negativity surrounding the people who carry some of the biggest names you know. I want my work to stand out among the other. I want a person to see something I have created and know it was me without having to ask to research. I crave individuality, and I aspire to achieve greatness.</p>
